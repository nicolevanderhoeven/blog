# Affiliate Links

On this page, you'll find my affiliate links. "Affiliate" means that when you use any of these links, I get something in return. Usually, these also give _you_ some benefit for using them. To see how I decide on affiliate links, check out my [Ethics Statement](https://nicolevanderhoeven.com/ethics/).
