In this video, I talk about the different ways that I learn in public, including how I use [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md), [Readwise](https://readwise.io/nicole), social networks like [Mastodon](https://pkm.social/@nicole), YouTube, and [Buttondown](https://tip.nicolevanderhoeven.com) to do so. I also announce my new in-progress book, [Doing It in Public](https://doingitinpublic.com).
