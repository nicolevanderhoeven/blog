In this Grafana Office Hours, we talk about the state of observability databases (Grafana Loki, Mimir, Tempo, and Pyroscope) and where they're going. We talk about current and upcoming architectural changes in all four, how we're making them more performant, how compatible they are with OpenTelemetry, and what we're working on next for each database. In this conversation are Dee Kitchen (VP of Engineering for Databases) and Senior Developer Advocates Jay Clifford and Nicole van der Hoeven.
