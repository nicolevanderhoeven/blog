What do you get when you combine AI microscopy with Grafana? Well, in this case, you get the Theiascope platform: an application for doing real-time analysis on microscopy images using a combination of Grafana, Prometheus, and PostgreSQL/Timescale. The Theiascope platform was a collaboration between Dr. Christopher Field, Co-Founder/President/ Principal Investigator at Theia Scientific and Mikhail Volkov, Founder/CEO of Volkov Labs.
