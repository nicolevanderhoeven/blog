Lost in all the Obsidian core plugins? Here's a video that goes through every single one of them: which ones I've left enabled, which ones I've disabled, and which community plugins I use instead. This "Obsidian Tour" series is about showing MY personal setup of Obsidian, not the "best" one. I'm hoping that sharing how I use these plugins will help you decide whether or not they could fit in your workflows, too.
