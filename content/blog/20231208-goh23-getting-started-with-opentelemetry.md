Principal Engineer Juraci Paixão Kröhling talks to my colleague [Paul Balogh](https://javaducky.com) and me about getting started with OpenTelemetry: what it is, why everyone's talking about it, and how to instrument your systems and improve their reliability and observability. Juraci is a contributor to open source projects like Jaeger and OpenTelemetry.
