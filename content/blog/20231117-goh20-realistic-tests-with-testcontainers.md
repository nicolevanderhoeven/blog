In this episode of Grafana Office Hours, we talk about realistic unit tests utilizing actual instances of databases and other dependencies. We'll be joined by Manuel de la Pe√±a from AtomicJar, and Pablo Chacin from Grafana to learn how we can use the Testcontainers open-source framework to create lightweight, throwaway dependencies for our tests.
