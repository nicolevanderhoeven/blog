I've done a lot of thinking about why not to make resolutions in 2024. In 2023, I went a little overboard with OKRs (Objectives and Key Results) and that just sent me spiralling into overwork and burnout. That's not something I want to see happen again this year, so instead, I'm doing a yearly theme: a one-word direction for the rest of the year that will act as a North Star rather than a strict set of rules. I'm hoping this will allow me to be productive, but also keep me happy.
