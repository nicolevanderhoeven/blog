So you're using Obsidian Templater, but what do you do when your template changes? What is YNAB? How do you use daily notes in workspaces? How do you process emails? These questions were sourced from the awesome [Patreons](https://patreon.com/nicolevdh) that support these videos. Thanks to you all!
