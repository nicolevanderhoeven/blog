Today I presented at the [Dutch Cloud Native Day 2025](https://www.dutchcloudnativeday.nl) in Utrecht, the Netherlands. I gave a talk titled *Asimov's Zeroth Law of Robotics: Observability for AI*, which I had previously presented at [KubeCon EU](/blog/20250402-asmiovs-zeroth-law-of-robotics/) earlier on in the year, in London. I was very happy to be able to present it again, because it gave me the opportunity to improve the demo app I used, which you can find on [GitHub](https://nicole.to/asimov).
