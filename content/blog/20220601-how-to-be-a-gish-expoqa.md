For the ExpoQA 2022 conference in Madrid, Spain, I presented a talk about how to be a gish. In this talk, I covered the following topics:
- what a gish is, and how it applies to the field of testing
- how testing is a multidisciplinary field, and why generalists triumph over specialists in the face of uncertainty
- how the tool we choose to do our testing informs the type of testing and the type of results we get
- a hands-on example of how to do API load testing, browser automation, and chaos engineering in one script using a tool like [k6](https://k6.io/)

There was no recording of the conference talk, but here is a video of me going through my presentation beforehand:
