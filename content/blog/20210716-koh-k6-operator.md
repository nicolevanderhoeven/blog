In this week's Office Hours, [Simme](https://simme.dev) and I talked about the [k6 Operator](https://github.com/grafana/k6-operator), which is a open-source project that Simme created for distributed load testing with k6.

k6 Cloud already offers a no-hassle distributed load testing experience, but for those who prefer to use their own infrastructure, k6 Operator allows the setup of a k6 test as a custom resource object that can be deployed along with a Kubernetes cluster.
