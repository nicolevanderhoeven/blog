In this Community Call, Senior Software Engineer Christian Haudum talks to us about bloom filter changes for Grafana Loki, including the deprecation of the bloom compactor and a pivot towards creating bloom filters for structured metadata. Bloom filters are a probabilistic data structure that we're using to improve query performance in Loki.

Community Calls are monthly meetings that are open to everyone interested in the development of Loki. They are an opportunity for software engineers working on Loki to discuss new features as well as for open-source users of Loki to ask questions. To participate in the next Community Call, [subscribe to the calendar here](https://gra.fan/lokicccal).
