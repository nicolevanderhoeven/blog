Readwise Reader is the latest read-it-later app, except not just for books. Reader brings in your highlights from books, articles, tweets, PDFs, epubs, emails, and even newsletters! While it's not yet officially launched, it's now in public beta and you can sign up to be put on a wait list to try out this awesome product that's been so essential to my workflows.

Note: I do have an affiliate link of [Readwise](https://readwise.io/nicole), but this video was not sponsored. They know I'm making this video, because I had to reach out to get permission to post the screenshot of a private email, but they did not review this video and had no idea what I was going to say. :)
