My friend Zsolt Viczián, a visual thinker and developer behind the plugins Obsidian Excalidraw and Obsidian ExcaliBrain, has written a book called "Sketch Your Mind: Nurture a Playful and Creative Brain". The book is about how to create a system for visual thinking that helps you to think better, make connections, and make things with your ideas.
