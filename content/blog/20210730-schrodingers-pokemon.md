This is a presentation I gave at [New Relic FutureStack 2021](https://newrelic.com/futurestack/speakers/nicole-van-der-hoeven).

Deploying an application to production is often like putting a pokémon in a box and hoping it manages to stay alive despite real-world chaos and potential outages. What can we, as testers, do to prepare applications for these situations before they go live? In this talk, I discuss chaos engineering concepts and demonstrates how to apply them by incorporating load tests with chaos experiments and setting up observability tools to watch it all happen. Because without observability, how can we tell whether Schrödinger's pokémon is alive or dead?
