I was a Roam Research power user, a Believer, and investor before I discovered Obsidian. Here's why I still ended up choosing Obsidian over Roam as my personal knowledge management tool of choice. My goal with this video is to share with you my reasons for making the choice that I did, not to judge you or anyone else who disagrees. In the end, we all have to decide for ourselves what tool fits best in our lives.
