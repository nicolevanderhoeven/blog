Recently, during Grafanaconline 2021, [Grafana Labs CEO Raj Dutt announced](https://grafana.com/about/press/2021-06-17-grafana-labs-brings-modern-open-source-load-testing-to-observability-with-acquisition-of-k6/) the acquisition of k6-- the company I work for. What does this mean? Here's a video I made to explain it all:

[Simme](https://simme.dev) and I have also discussed the acquisition twice on k6 Office Hours:
- [once with our CEO, Robin Gustafsson](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrDo2wMeV80)
- and another time with [both Robin and Raj, Grafana Labs CEO](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfWIB-myito)

TL;DW: We unanimously agree it's a positive thing. I myself am cautiously optimistic about the future of both k6 and Grafana Labs.
