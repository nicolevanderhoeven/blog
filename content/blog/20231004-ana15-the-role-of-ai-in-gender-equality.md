In this episode of Adobo and Avocados, my friend [Marie Cruz](https://testingwithmarie.com) and I chat with [Nicola Martin](https://linktr.ee/nlmit), Head of Quality Engineering at Adarga, to talk about the role of AI, technology, and education in gender equality.

Nicola is a Council and Committee Member for the British Computer Society and WomenTech Global Network. She is also a mentor, speaker, and panelist speaking on subjects such as AI and quality, software testing, and diversity in tech.
