Nikola Grƒçevski, Principal Software Engineer at Grafana Labs, gives us an introduction to eBPF with Grafana Beyla. We discuss what is eBPF, how you can use it to auto-instrument applications, and how to get started with Beyla. eBPF observability is all the rage because we all want automagical instrumentation-- but does it live up to that promise? Nikola's here to tell us what eBPF can and can't do, and where he'd like to take Beyla next.
