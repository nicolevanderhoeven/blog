Another travel vlog from safer times: in September 2018, my husband and I took a friend out to Grotten Sint Pietersberg, a fortress and cave system in Maastricht, the Netherlands. They had been used in the times before that area was not yet part of the city of Maastricht; they were in a small village called Sint Pietersberg that had gotten caught between several invading foreign armies and the people of Maastricht. We enjoyed the day out!
