My friend [Marie Cruz](https://testingwithmarie.com) and I presented today at [Agile Testing Days 2023](https://agiletestingdays.com/) in Potsdam, Germany. Our talk was called [Adobo & Avocados: Intersectionality in Tech and DevRel](https://agiletestingdays.com/2023/session/adobo-and-avocados-intersectionality-in-tech-and-devrel/). We talked about what intersectionality is, shared our personal experiences regarding diversity and intersecting identities, and gave tips on how to think about intersectionality as we build and use software.
