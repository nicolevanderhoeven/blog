Here's a list of my daily tech for work and play-- all the everyday tech gear I use in these categories: laptops, mobiles, tablets, ereaders, wearables, and audio. I like to get the best devices for my use cases, but I'm also willing to use multiple devices in each category if I have a need for it.
