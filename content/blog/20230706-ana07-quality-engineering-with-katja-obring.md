Developer Advocates Marie Cruz and I talk to Katja Obring, an experienced Quality Engineering Coach, about her experience in tech and moving to freelance for better work-life balance. We also talk about her book, "Testing in DevOps: A Guide to Optimised Testing for Speedy and High Quality Delivery," and how Testing fits in the overall DevOps landscape, the importance of automated testing, and the cultural changes crucial to DevOps.
