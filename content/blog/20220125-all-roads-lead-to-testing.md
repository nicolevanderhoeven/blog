# Why all roads lead to testing

Testing is a skill every software engineer should develop.

It's easy to dismiss testing as a responsibility only some carry, but it's best thought of as a hat that _anyone_ can put on. How well you learn to wear this hat affects your career whether or not you're a tester. Here's why.

## Ideas are cheap.

In tech, having an idea isn't what sells-- the success is in the execution.

iPhones didn't become popular because it was the first mobile with a touchscreen. The Nintendo Switch isn't ubiquitous because of its revolutionary hardware. Behind every successful product is a lot of testing.

## Testing isn't just for testers.

Every good software engineer does testing.

Debugging is a form of testing. Questioning requirements is a form of testing. Testers don't (and shouldn't) have a monopoly on testing. The reality is that everyone is doing it, often without calling it "testing".

## Testing is about people more than it is about machines.

The fundamental goal of any app is to address a human need.

Testing is finding new ways to represent and understand this need at all stages of development. Testing is a people problem, not a technical problem.

## Humans are irrational.

The biggest challenge in building apps is human irrationality.

We don't always _want_ what we need, we don't always _know_ what we need, and even when we're building _for_ others, we don't always _work_ towards what we need. Testing is an attempt to make sense of this irrationality.

## Testing is an attitude.

Getting good at testing extends to aspects beyond work.

Testing is a discipline of questioning. It's having curiosity as a default state and trying to meet people where they are. These are things every project, and every community, needs in spades.

## Testing is rarely the destination.

But some time, some how, all roads lead to testing.
