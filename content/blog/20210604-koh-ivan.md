This week on k6 Office Hours, [Simme](https://simme.dev) and I were joined by [Iv치n Szkiba](https://twitter.com/szkiba) and [Mihail Stoykov](https://twitter.com/MStoykov) to talk all about extensions. Iv치n, who is a System Architect at NNG LLC, is the most active k6 extension creator outside of the k6 team. Mihail is a software engineer at k6, and one third of the k6 OSS team.

We talked about the many extensions Iv치n has created for k6 so that he can incorporate k6 into his team's daily testing activities, his considerations for creating extensions, and how he got started. Mihail also shares some inside information on why certain decisions were made about the way k6 is structured, and common mistakes he sees people make in their custom extensions.
