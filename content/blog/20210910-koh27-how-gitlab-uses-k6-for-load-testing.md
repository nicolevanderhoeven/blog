[Grant Young](https://www.linkedin.com/in/grantyoung86/), Software Engineer in Test at GitLab, joined [k6 OSS](https://grafana.com/k6) maintainer [Mihail Stoykov](https://twitter.com/MStoykov) and me to talk about how GitLab uses k6. Apparently, they began using k6 internally some time ago, and because they like to eat their own dogfood and use GitLab to test GitLab, they also incorporated k6 into GitLab so that their users could reap the benefits, too.

[Here's the GitLab documentation](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/merge_requests/load_performance_testing.html) about how to do load testing in GitLab, and [here's a k6 blog post](https://k6.io/blog/integrating-load-testing-with-gitlab/) on how to set it up!
