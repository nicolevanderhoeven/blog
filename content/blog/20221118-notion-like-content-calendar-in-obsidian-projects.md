If you're looking to create a content calendar in Obsidian just like in Notion, the new Obsidian Projects plugin presents new options for managing content using multiple views: Table, Board, Calendar, and Gallery to start with, but hopefully more in the future. Projects is a framework for creating new views for the same data and aims to play well with other plugins.
