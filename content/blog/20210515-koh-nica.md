We were happy to welcome [Nočnica Fee](https://www.twitch.tv/serverlessmom) from [New Relic](https://www.twitch.tv/new_relic) to k6 Office Hours. She very bravely volunteered to learn how to use k6-- live! Talk about pressure. But she handled it like a champ!

We also talked about why observability is both particularly important and particularly difficult in serverless architecture. There will definitely be a part two at some point!
