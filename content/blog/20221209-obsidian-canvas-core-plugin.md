The new Obsidian Canvas core plugin was introduced recently in v1.1.0, currently available only to Insiders but soon available to everyone. Canvas is an optional plugin that gives Obsidian an infinitely scrolling space to arrange notes, media, and other cards (potentially including external websites). If you've heard of [Scrintal](https://www.scrintal.com/), this core plugin brings some of the same visual thinking workflows to Obsidian, which I think is a very smart step.
