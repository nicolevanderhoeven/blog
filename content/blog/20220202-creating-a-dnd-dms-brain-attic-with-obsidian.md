I started using [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) for professional reasons. I use it daily as my main task management and personal knowledge management system for my main job as a software developer advocate at [k6.io](https://k6.io). However, a surprising use case of mine for Obsidian is playing Dungeons & Dragons, the tabletop roleplaying game.

Here's a video of me walking through my setup for how to use Obsidian to create my own "DM's Brain Attic".
