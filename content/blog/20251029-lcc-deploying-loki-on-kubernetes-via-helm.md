This Loki Community Call is about deploying Loki on Kubernetes via Helm charts. We talk about why you might want to use Helm to deploy on Kubernetes, best practices for deployment, and which Helm chart you should use! We are Jay Clifford and Nicole van der Hoeven, Developer Advocates at Grafana Labs, and we have invited Grafana Champion and Loki Helm Maintainer Jan-Otto Kröpke, Principal Cloud Architect at QualityOperations GmbH, to talk about the state of the Loki Helm Chart.
