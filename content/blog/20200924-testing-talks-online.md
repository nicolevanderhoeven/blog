> Performance testing is an essential part of the quality assurance function. However, across the industry the great majority of companies still struggle to master and execute a successful performance testing strategy that produces measurable results.
> In this panel discussion, Cameron Bradley will host some of the best performance engineers in the world. The panel will discuss how we as quality assurance experts and performance engineers can better understand performance testing, the value of performance testing and how world leaders are approaching and succeeding with performance testing as part of the delivery life cycle.
