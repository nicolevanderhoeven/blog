In this video, I go through everything that's in my remote work setup while traveling for a month in 5 different countries-- all in one backpack and one sling. I work remotely full-time, and in this trip I have three talks in one month, several meetups with friends and family, and livestreams to do. Here's what I chose to bring with me to remain fully operational while also travelling.
