On this week's Office Hours, [Simme](https://simme.dev) and I were joined by [Robin Gustafsson](https://www.linkedin.com/in/robinegustafsson/), the CEO of k6, to make a big announcement: k6 has been acquired by Grafana Labs.

The folks at Grafana Labs have been fans of k6 for a while, and we've been fans (and users) of their work since almost the beginning of k6. While a surprise to many, Grafana and k6 together is a combination that makes sense.

Read [Grafana's press release here](https://grafana.com/about/press/2021-06-17-grafana-labs-brings-modern-open-source-load-testing-to-observability-with-acquisition-of-k6/) to hear more about this milestone.
