I presented at [TestCon Europe 2023](https://testcon.lt/) in Vilnius, Lithuania about emergent load testing, and how to use it to find the limits of your system. My talk was called [Emergent load testing: Rules for Organized Chaos](https://events.pinetool.ai/3078/#sessions/100686?referrer%5Bpathname%5D=%2Fsessions&referrer%5Bsearch%5D=&referrer%5Btitle%5D=Sessions).
