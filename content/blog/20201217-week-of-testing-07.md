I decided to make a final wrap-up video for my "Week of Testing" with k6... ok, so it's actually three weeks later now, but I wanted to explore k6 a little bit more before I gave my opinion on it.

Thank you, k6, for being awesome enough to agree to this video series before knowing what I'd say. Gotta love a company that welcomes transparency and feedback.
