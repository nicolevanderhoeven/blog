I first heard of [Stephen Townshend](https://twitter.com/perftestnz) because he happens to have gotten the same introduction to performance testing that I did-- our shared mentor, [Stijn Schephers](https://www.linkedin.com/in/stijnschepers/). He has started a podcast called Performance Time, where he interviews performance engineers about a variety of topics. This week, it was me!

We talked about how I got started, one of my biggest failures as a performance tester, chaos engineering, what we can do to improve diversity in tech, and why I think note-taking is a key skill for any performance tester.
