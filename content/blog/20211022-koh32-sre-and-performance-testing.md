In this week's Office Hours, I wanted to talk about the intersection of Site Reliability Engineering and performance testing, so I decided to invite two people with different backgrounds from me to discuss it. Stephen Townshend is a performance engineer who recently changed jobs to become an SRE, and Daniel Gonz√°lez Lopes is an SRE who had not had experience in performance testing before he joined k6. It turned out to be a great talk!
