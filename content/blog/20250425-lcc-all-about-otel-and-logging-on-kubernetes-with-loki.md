In this pre-recorded Loki Community Call, we talk all about OTel and logging on Kubernetes with Cyril Tovena, Ward Bekker, Jay Clifford, and Nicole van der Hoeven at KubeCon EU 2025 in London. We discuss when why you should switch to OTel and why you shouldn't, what OTLP is exactly, and best practices for ingesting data through an OTLP endpoint.
