Here are some of the highlights:
- We've created an official [k6 Prometheus Grafana dashboard](https://grafana.com/grafana/dashboards/19665-k6-prometheus/) and [another dashboard for Prometheus with native histograms](https://grafana.com/grafana/dashboards/18030-k6-prometheus-native-histograms/).
- New APIs have been added for Prometheus Remote Write output for k6 (authentication and HTTP headers).
- We've increased the character limit for metric names from 63 to 128, aligned with the OpenTelemetry specification update.
- k6 browser tests can be executed in Grafana Cloud by everyone.
- We've improved the cookie API for k6 browser.
- We've added support for `page.on('console')` for k6 browser.
- There are now official Docker images that include a Chromium-based browser for running k6 browser tests within CI/CD pipelines.
- Distributed tracing is in public preview for Grafana Cloud.
- [xk6-file](https://github.com/avitalique/xk6-file) is a new extension that lets you rename files within your k6 script.
- [xk6-gcp](https://github.com/deejiw/xk6-gcp) is a new extension that adds k6 support for messaging using Google PubSub.
- [xk6-dashboard](https://github.com/grafana/xk6-dashboard) is now an official Grafana extension that lets you generate HTML dashboards from k6 test results.
- [k6x](https://github.com/szkiba/k6x) is a new utility that automatically detects when you import k6 extensions and builds the custom k6 binary for you so that you don't have to.
- [k6-operator](https://github.com/grafana/k6-operator) now has a Helmchart deployment option.
