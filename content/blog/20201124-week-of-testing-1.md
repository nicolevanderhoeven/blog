On my first real day of testing with [k6.io](https://k6.io), I wanted to jump right in and figure out how to run a load test on k6 Cloud. k6 has documentation on this, but I didn't use it for this test, since the point of a week of testing is to record how easy the product is to use.

My verdict: I'm pleasantly surprised with how easily everything went. Is it just me, or was that AWS startup time exceptionally fast? I'm used to AWS taking at least a couple of minutes to provision a machine, but this seemed to start up almost instantaneously.
