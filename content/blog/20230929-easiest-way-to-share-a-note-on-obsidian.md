Obsius Publish is a new Obsidian plugin that lets you share a note on Obsidian for free. It's best used as a complement to Obsidian Publish in that it particularly shines when wanting to share notes temporarily. Obsius Publish is a third-party community plugin that adds commands to Obsidian to let you push the contents of a note to Obsius and gives you a shareable link to make the note accessible over the internet.
