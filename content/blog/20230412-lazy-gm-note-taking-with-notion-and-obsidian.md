How does Mike Shea (Sly Flourish) do lazy GM note taking with Notion? Mike shows me how he uses Notion to prep and run games, and I'm taking the opportunity to show him some of how I do the same in Obsidian. Mike is the author of several RPG-related books, including the Return of the Lazy Dungeon Master and his latest, The Lazy DM's Companion. Mike has been playing RPGs for almost 40 years and is a forever DM. He also has a YouTube channel where he releases two videos weekly: one about news in the RPG community and one where he preps live for one of his games.
