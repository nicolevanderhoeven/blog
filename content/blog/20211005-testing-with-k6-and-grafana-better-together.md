In this first EMEA session of the Grafana Labs virtual meetups, I talked about how to use k6 and Grafana together to get the full performance picture for a software application. Observability, using tools like Prometheus and Grafana, lets us see what's going on inside the application, and load testing, using k6, helps us get those insights earlier on in software cycles, such as during pre-production.
