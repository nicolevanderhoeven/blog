Tonight I did a webinar with Grafana Labs-- the first k6-related webinar since the acquisition. I was more than a little nervous to give it, because I knew I was introducing k6 to a lot of new users, but also to Grafana for the first time. I think it went pretty well! I was still quite relieved when it was over, however. :)

In the webinar, I talk about:
- why it's still a good idea to do load testing in pre-production
- what k6 is
- why k6 and Grafana together make sense
- and how to integrate k6 and Grafana

There's quite a bit of demo in it, and I also had the k6 CEO, Robin Gustafsson, join me for Q&A as a nice treat.

Check out the full webinar [here](https://grafana.com/go/webinar/intro-to-load-testing-with-grafana-and-k6/)-- it's already up on the Grafana site. You can also go through my slides [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1WOA50nqIv1NoiHBxGIH_JM02rZqSjX81gHTlwPJ5i1U/edit?usp=sharing), if you'd like.
