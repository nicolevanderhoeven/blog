I'm very lucky to have the opportunity to work with [Liudmila Molkova](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lmolkova/), who just joined as a Staff Developer Advocate at Grafana Labs. We decided we would start a new monthly livestream called the Grafana ❤️‍🔥 OpenTelemetry Community Call. In this inaugural episode, we interviewed [Marylia Gutierrez](https://www.linkedin.com/in/maryliag/) about declarative configuration for OpenTelemetry SDKs. We talked about:
- Pains in getting started with OpenTelemetry, particularly around instrumentation and configuration
- What declarative configuration is, and how it improves the experience
- Which languages declarative configuration is for
- The future of declarative configuration in OpenTelemetry
- Marylia's candidacy for Governing Committee of OTel ([vote for her here](https://gra.fan/otelvote) from October 27th-30th, 2025)
