Today I spoke at the [Linking Your Thinking](https://lu.ma/3m1fh781) conference about what I do with notes I take, and how I manage to use them to actually create stuff.

I'll update this post with the link to the video in the future, but for now, [here are the slides](https://slides.nicolevanderhoeven.com/2022-use-it-or-lose-it/#)!
