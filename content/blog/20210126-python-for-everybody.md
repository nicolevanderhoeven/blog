I'm starting off the new year by learning something new. I am a big fan of non-traditional education, and [Coursera](https://coursera.org) is a platform I've used a few times before. You may not get courses that qualify as university credit, but I've found it to be a useful resource for learning. I might be biased (my university degree is in Economics, which I've never used), but in some ways, I actually prefer a MOOC (that's a Massively Open Online Course) to a typical formal university course for a few reasons:

- MOOCs are entirely online, which means it's more accessible - I don't need to physically be in the US to take a course at Harvard

- MOOCs are usually self-paced - perfect for someone working full-time like me

- MOOCs are free or cheap - no huge student loans here; MOOCs are democratizing education and making it available to more people

- Good online education tends to be more practical. There is none of the intellectual posturing that I've seen in physical classrooms; there are no random classes you need to take to get a fancy piece of paper. I love being able to choose a topic and learn ONLY that-- and get right down to business in the first lesson.

- Formal education is often centered around getting students jobs, not helping workers do their jobs well. I already have a job, and I want to learn real, usable skills, not "marketable" ones.

My main complaint with MOOCs was that they tend to be short (in comparison to a formal course), but Coursera has addressed that somewhat with their specializations. A specialization is a series of courses, but it's more than just disparate courses that are strung together; it's a thoughtfully designed curriculum that builds up on knowledge from previous courses. Last year, I began learning Python.

Why Python? Others might have different reasons, but here were mine:

- Python is one of the best languages to learn for data analysis (the other being R). I've always been interested in data visualization, and as a load tester, I'm frequently exposed to large quantities of data that I somehow need to make sense of.

- Python is pretty good at retrieving data from websites, and I wanted to explore how good it is to use in load testing. I'm always eager to learn different ways to test, and I've wanted to try [Locust](https://locust.io/) for a while.

- Python is increasing in popularity, and I wanted to see why.

So I decided to take the [Python for Everybody Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/learn/python) from the University of Michigan (via Coursera) to get an introduction to this cool language. The specialization consists of five modules, each of which I had to take separately:

- Programming for Everybody (Getting Started with Python)

- Python Data Structure

- Using Python to Access Web Data

- Using Databases with Python

- Capstone: Retrieving, Processing, and Visualizing Data with Python

The specialization was really fun, and the teacher, Charles Severance, is fantastic. I'd taken courses from him before, so I knew what to expect. He didn't disappoint. He has a way of explaining daunting technical concepts in a way that's easy to digest for beginners.

You can [check out my certificate here](https://coursera.org/share/11534b2c1b88aa2ab1f0098ebbe32e18). I'm pretty happy with my progress. I'm by no means a Python expert now, but I'm definitely eager to keep learning how to do more things with this new knowledge.
