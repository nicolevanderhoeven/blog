What is a visual Personal Knowledge Management (PKM) and how can it help you make connections between your notes? Zsolt Vizcain, developer of the Obsidian Excalidraw and Excalibrain plugins, joins me to talk about how to use his plugins to make your PKM system more visual.

Zsolt makes videos too! Check his channel out: https://www.youtube.com/c/VisualPKM
