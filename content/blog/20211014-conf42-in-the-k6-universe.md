[Miko Pawlikowski](https://twitter.com/mikopawlikowski) interviewed [Simme Aronsson](https://simme.dev) and I for the [Conf42 podcast](https://www.conf42.com/podcast), and we talked about:

- why I love to learn human languages, and what Esperanto sounds like
- the Grafana acquisition of k6
- what performance testing is, anyway
- whether everyone needs to do performance testing, and my personal setup for this blog
- chaos engineering and Schrödinger's Pokémon
- an overview of the Grafana Labs projects landscape
- what k6 is, and how we would get started for free (k6 OSS)
