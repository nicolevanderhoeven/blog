Here's a fun little vlog that I've been meaning to make of the last trip my husband Rob and I took before the pandemic. In January 2020, we went to see my cousin and her daughter (my "niece", whom I grew up with) in London. My niece, Steffi, had just arrived in London for some studies abroad (she normally lives in the Philippines), so Rob and I popped over to meet up with her and help her settle in.

Poor thing-- not a month after Steffi got to London, news of the pandemic began to spread. Rob and I had intended to visit her again, but of course that didn't happen.
