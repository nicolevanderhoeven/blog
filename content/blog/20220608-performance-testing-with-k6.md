[Darin Pope](https://twitter.com/DarinPope) and [Viktor Farcic](https://twitter.com/vfarcic) from the [DevOps Paradox podcast](https://www.devopsparadox.com/) and the [DevOps Toolkit YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/DevOpsToolkit) invited me onto their show to talk about performance testing with k6, and why it's awesome to be able to write load tests in languages that aren't vendor-specific!
