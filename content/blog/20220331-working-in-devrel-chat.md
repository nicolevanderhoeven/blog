My good friend [Gift Egwuenu](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCgUgg53iJX1pdabUxpkgozA), a Developer Advocate at [Cloudflare](https://cloudflare.com), invited me to a livestream on her channel to talk about what Developer Advocacy is, what I do at k6, and how we both got started in the Netherlands. Gift and I have a lot in common, so I was happy to be on her channel!
