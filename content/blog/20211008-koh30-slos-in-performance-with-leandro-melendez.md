In this Office Hours, I invited my colleague Tom Miseur and friend Leandro Melendez, aka Señor Performo, to talk all about different criteria in performance testing, including non-functional requirements, SLAs, SLOs, SLIs, thresholds, and checks. Criteria at different levels is how we determine whether testing, including performance testing, has been successful, so it's important to understand what they are and incorporate them into testing scripts and processes.
