[Postman](https://www.postman.com/) is a near-ubiquitous tool for anyone doing API testing, and many teams use collections to create and organize complicated test suites. However, there's one thing that Postman isn't good at: load testing. That's where k6 comes in.

In this video, [Tim Haselaars](https://twitter.com/timhaselaars) joined k6 Office Hours to talk to [Paul Balogh](https://twitter.com/javaducky) and me about how to use Postman collections to run load tests using k6.
