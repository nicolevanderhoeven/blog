This week on k6 Office Hours, [Simme](https://simme.dev) and I were joined by two CEOs: k6 CEO [Robin Gustafsson](https://www.linkedin.com/in/robinegustafsson/) and Grafana Labs CEO [Raj Dutt](https://twitter.com/nopzor). It was a little nerve-wracking to have two CEOs on the stream, but it did give us the opportunity to ask both of them pointed questions on Grafana Labs's acquisition of k6, including any plans they have for how both companies could integrate better in the future.
