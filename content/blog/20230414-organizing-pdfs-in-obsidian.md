There are many tools for organizing PDFs in Obsidian, but which one is the best? In this video, I go through several options, including DevonThink, Readwise, Skim, and Zotero. For my (non-academic) use case of organizing my TTRPG-related PDFs, I decided on Zotero-- but maybe something else will be better for you!
