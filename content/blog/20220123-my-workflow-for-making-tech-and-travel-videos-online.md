In the last 5 years, I've made ~220 videos across 4 YouTube channels. Here's what I've learned so far about making videos.

## **Why make videos?**

A 10-minute video takes me anywhere from 7 to 15 hours to produce. I wouldn't be doing it if I didn't enjoy it!

-   It can be the most genuine form of expression.
    
-   Videos were a big part of how _I_ got into tech, and I want to pass that on.
    
-   I'd rather make a video once than explain the same thing to 100 people.
    

I don't think my way is the _best_ way, but maybe sharing my workflow will make it easier for you to get started, too!

### **Pre-production: Ideation**

**Ideas are cheap**. The best idea is worthless if I can't convey it well.

I start with the idea, then the title and thumbnail. I search YouTube to see what titles have worked for others. Then, I use @Canva for thumbnail creation and [thumbsup.tv](http://thumbsup.tv) to test combinations.

Only then do I start to outline the video or research it. I use @obsdmd as my project management tool and content calendar.

### **Production: Filming and editing**

I like to film with talking points rather than a full script. It saves me time, and it comes across as more natural. My main gear: Sony A6600 + Sigma 16mm f/1.4, Røde PodMic, Elgato keylight.

I edit everything myself in Final Cut Pro, using stock footage from @StoryblocksCo and sound effects/music from @epidemicsound.

### **Post-production: Publishing**

I export and upload the video to YouTube, adding the title, thumbnail, description, cards, end screen... I have a checklist so I don't forget these.

I send most videos to humans at @Rev for captioning. I then use the captions to create YouTube chapters. From there, it's just about publishing to appropriate platforms.

## Optimize for consistency and fun

When in doubt, I chuck technique out the window and do what will keep video creation fun for me!
