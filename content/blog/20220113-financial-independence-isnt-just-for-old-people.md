5 years ago, at age 31, I became financially independent.

Financial independence (FI) means that if I wanted to retire tomorrow, I could. I'd have to make significant changes to my life to do it, but I'd have a plan, and enough resources at hand to get by.

Unfortunately, just talking about FI is uncommon at best and taboo at worst, even in an industry with higher-than-average salaries like tech.

You might be thinking that I received some sort of inheritance or unexpected windfall. The truth is that 10 years ago, my husband and I were in credit card debt and had no major assets. Now he's retired, and I have a job I love.

The funny thing is, there's really nothing magical about how we got here.

## Here's how you can do it too.

### **Step 1: Track your money.**

You can't fix something you aren't monitoring.

To this day, my husband and I use ([YNAB](http://youneedabudget.com)) to track every cent of our money, whether we're saving it or spending it. When your financial situation is right there in black and white, it's hard to ignore.

### **Step 2: Reduce your expenses.**

Too many people focus on earning more, when the reality is that it's far easier to adjust what you're _spending_.

You can afford (almost) anything, but you can't afford everything-- so figure out what matters. Reducing your expenses is even better than getting a raise. Do regular audits of fixed expenses. If you have a partner, consider living on less than one income and banking the other entirely.

### **Step 3: Automate investments.**

Set up a recurring monthly payment for a painful amount of money. Invest in low-cost ETFs like Vanguard's _and then forget about them_. Resign yourself to living at your current lifestyle level (or lower), and don't live it up when you get a raise.

And for those who want a goal post, as I did: **Actually calculate the minimum amount you'd need to retire**. It may be less than you think.

Money isn't everything, but it can be. To someone who doesn't have it, money can buy freedom.
