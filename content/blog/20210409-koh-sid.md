For this week's k6 Office Hours, [Simme](https://simme.dev) and I had [Sid Palas](https://twitter.com/sidpalas) from [DevOps Directive](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4MdpjzjPuop_qWNAvR23JA) come on board to talk about what Kubernetes is, how it relates to Infrastructure as Code, and why either of those should matter to testers.
