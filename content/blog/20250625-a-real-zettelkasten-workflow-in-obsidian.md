I recently had the pleasure of joining my friends [Tris Oaten of No Boilerplate on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@NoBoilerplate) and [Bob Doto](https://writing.bobdoto.computer/zettelkasten/) on my YouTube channel for a discussion on Zettelkasten, including demos of all three of our real Zettelkasten workflows in Obsidian. We talked extensively about the differences in how we maintain our Zettelk√§sten and plugins that we use to do so. We particularly talked a lot about *folgezettel*, and how the Obsidian Breadcrumbs plugin can be used to implement this concept in Obsidian.

If you're interested in this topic, you might also like Bob's book [A System for Writing](https://amzn.to/469VQOF): How an Unconventional Approach to Note-Making Can Help You Capture Ideas, Think Wildly, and Write Constantly. I reviewed it and found it extremely useful, and Tris and I both use it as a reference for our Zettelkasten workflows.
