In this super last-minute video, I talked about 10 awesome bits of tech I've loved throughout this year, and why I think each of them would make great gifts for the techie in your life (or maybe even yourself).

Below are all the items I mentioned. I include affiliate links where possible, so I will get a miniscule commission if you buy something through my link. However, I wouldn't be recommending these if I didn't genuinely use and love them all!
