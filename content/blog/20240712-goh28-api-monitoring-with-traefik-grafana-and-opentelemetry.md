Maytham Alfouadi (Solutions Architect) and Immánuel Fodor (Product Manager) from Traefik Labs give us a demonstration of how to do API monitoring with Traefik, Grafana, and OpenTelemetry. They talk about Traefik, an open-source reverse proxy, among other things, that is now included by default in k3s and Rancher. They are joined by Usman Ahmad and Nicole van der Hoeven, both Senior Developer Advocates at Grafana Labs.
