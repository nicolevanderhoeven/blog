I'm writing a book in Obsidian-- about Obsidian! And I want to share it all with you. This is the beginning of that journey: what I'm starting with, my idea, and the plugins I'm using to get it done. This is all a work in progress, so if you have any suggestions about what I should do, I'd love to hear them!
