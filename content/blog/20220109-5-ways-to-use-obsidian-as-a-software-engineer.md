Yesterday, I wrote about why I think taking notes is the surprising foundation of a tester's career.

But it's not just testers. Every software engineer is a knowledge worker, and that means we get paid for what we know. Using a Personal Knowledge Management (PKM) system such as [Obsidian.md](http://Obsidian.md) helps us keep up with the constant barrage of new ideas in tech.

Here are 5 things I use Obsidian for.

## #1: My very own Stack Overflow

If you code, you've used Stack Overflow.

What if you had your **own** Stack Overflow, one that contained cheat sheets of every language you've ever tried to hack something up in, including only commands relevant to your job? This is exactly [what I've done for Python](https://notes.nicolevanderhoeven.com/Python) recently, and it's helping me solidify my knowledge.

## #2: Tools database

There's a tool for everything.

To keep them straight, I have a page for every load testing tool I try, with tutorials for how to get started, an assessment of its features, and observations I had while attempting to learn it. [Here's what I have for the load testing tool k6](https://notes.nicolevanderhoeven.com/k6+(tool)).

Bonus: I also use [the Dataview plugin](https://github.com/blacksmithgu/obsidian-dataview) to query tools that fit my criteria.

## #3: An Agile workspace

If Agile is good enough for my professional work, it's good enough for my personal work.

I use the [Kanban plugin](https://github.com/mgmeyers/obsidian-kanban) to keep track of projects, create weekly and monthly review/retro templates, and work iteratively using [the Incremental Writing plugin](https://github.com/bjsi/incremental-writing).

## #4: A public learning log

Learning in public is the fastest way to improve.

When I'm trying to figure something out, I document my attempts. With Obsidian Publish, I can quickly push this log out to my domain and share them with colleagues to get a quick review so that they can easily follow my train of thought and tell me where I went wrong.

## #5: A digital garden of software ideas

Build libraries, not feeds.

I use Obsidian to save things I read/watch/listen to but also to save space for ideas I've learned to germinate. I publish notes before they're fully fleshed out, with the goal of growing everything over time.

[Today, I have 4,567 notes](https://notes.nicolevanderhoeven.com), all about things that matter to me.

**Every engineer should have a PKM system.**
