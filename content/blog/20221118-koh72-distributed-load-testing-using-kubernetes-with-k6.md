My colleague Paul Balogh and I demonstrate how to run distributed load testing using Kubernetes with k6 and k6 operator. k6 can already run up to 40,000 virtual users from a single load generator, but if you want to scale that up further, you can use the Kubernetes operator to create a k6 custom resource within your cluster.
