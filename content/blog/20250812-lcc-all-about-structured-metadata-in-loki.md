In this video, [Jay Clifford](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jaymand13/) and I talk to Senior Software Engineer Salva Corts Sánchez from the Loki team about structured metadata in Loki. We discuss what it is, why you might want to use it, and also how to query it. Structured metadata is especially useful if you're instrumenting your system with OpenTelemetry, so we also touch on that.
