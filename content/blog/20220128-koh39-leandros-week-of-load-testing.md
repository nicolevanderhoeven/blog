This week for k6 Office Hours, I talked to one of the newest members on our team, [Leandro Melendez, aka Señor Performo](https://srperf.com), about his experience in joining k6/Grafana Labs. We ended up talking about performance "deadly sins" and how the practice of performance engineering has changed in the last decade.
