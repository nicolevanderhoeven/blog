Today, my former colleague [Simon Aronsson](https://simme.dev) brought his _new_ colleague, [Michele Mancioppi](https://twitter.com/mmanciop), to k6 Office Hours to talk about observability, and how they do it at [Canonical](https://canonical.com). It turned into a great conversation about trends in observability from the last decade, and how it relates to performance and reliability testing.
