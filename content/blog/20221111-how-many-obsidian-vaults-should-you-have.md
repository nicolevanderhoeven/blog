The more notes you have, the more you might wonder if you should have multiple vaults in Obsidian. There is no definitive answer, but in this video, I talk about reasons you should have only one vault as well as good reasons to have several vaults, based on my own experience. Like with anything I say, take what's useful and do what makes sense!
