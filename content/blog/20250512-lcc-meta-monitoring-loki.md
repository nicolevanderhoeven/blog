In this Loki Community Call, we talk about the need for meta-monitoring Loki: why Loki needs to be monitored, what to watch out for, and how to do it. We talk about different ways to get information from Loki that allow you to make it reliable, consistent, and performant, including a Helm chart to deploy a meta-monitoring stack on Kubernetes. We discuss the Loki mixin for Grafana and how to use it to visualize data about Loki. On the call are Jay Clifford, Nicole van der Hoeven, and Dylan Guedes from Grafana Labs.
