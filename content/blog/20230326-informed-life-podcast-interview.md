Information architect, author, and educator Jorge Arango [interviewed me on his podcast](https://theinformed.life/2023/03/26/episode-110-nicole-van-der-hoeven/), *The Informed Life*, about how I apply the principles of CI/CD to taking notes, why I use Obsidian, and how I use it to learn in public and play roleplaying games.
