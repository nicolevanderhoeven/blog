My friend [Marie Drake](https://mariedrake.com) and I teamed up to give a presentation about performance testing at a [Ministry of Testing (Philippines) meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Ministry-of-Testing-Manila/events/276622895/), and we talked about using [Cypress](https://cypress.io) for front-end performance testing and [k6](https://k6.io) for back-end performance testing.
