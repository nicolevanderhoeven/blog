In this video, I show you my favorite method for taking notes on podcasts with Snipd, Readwise, and Obsidian: three tools that work very well together. Snipd is a mobile podcast player app for iOS and Android that integrates with Readwise. With the Readwise Official plugin for Obsidian, that means my highlights and notes from podcasts end up automatically in my Obsidian vault, tagged appropriately.
