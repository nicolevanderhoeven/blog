Visual atomic note taking in Obsidian can be a great complement to taking notes in text form if you use tools like the Obsidian Excalidraw plugin. Obsidian Excalidraw lets you link and backlink with images, tag them for querying later, and even embed images AND parts of images. It's an essential part of taking notes visually while not missing out on the benefits of plain text.
