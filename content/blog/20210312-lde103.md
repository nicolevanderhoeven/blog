This is a travel video from January 2020, when my husband Rob and I did a roadtrip in Scotland with our good friends, Nikki and Basti Filler. This is towards the tail end of that trip, and it involved some of the best scenery I've ever seen. Scotland is a gorgeous country that we thoroughly enjoyed exploring, despite its awful weather. As a bonus, this was also our first trip with our new niece, Cassie.
