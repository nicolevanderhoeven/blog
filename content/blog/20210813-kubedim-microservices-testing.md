Today, my colleague [Daniel Gonz√°lez Lopes](https://www.gonzalezlopes.com/) joined me as a co-host on k6 Office Hours, and we interviewed [Kelvin Zhang](https://twitter.com/kelvzhan) about his thesis at Imperial College London, using k6 to test microservices-based architectures. He created something called Kubedim, an application that intelligently applies non-uniform brownout theory to intentionally dim application requests for the purpose of improving overall availability.

This was a dense Office Hours to digest, but Kelvin really impressed us with his experiments and findings! It's definitely an awesome use case for k6 and just a great one to watch for any site reliability engineer.
