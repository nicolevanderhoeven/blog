[Kevin Ohashi](https://twitter.com/kevinohashi) joined me and [Floor Drees](https://twitter.com/FloorDrees/) on k6 Office Hours to talk about how he used k6 to [benchmark the performance of WordPress hosting providers](https://wphostingbenchmarks.com/). He talks about the difficulties he ran into while trying to keep tests repeatable and consistent, and I also make some suggestions for how he could improve his load testing script for future comparisons.

Of particular note for me in his results was how clearly the performance of the hosting providers varied depending on the location Kevin had selected for his load generators. One in particular showed a significant delay when a site was fetched from Sydney, indicating the possibility of a lack of a CDN server in that region. It made a great argument for load testing in the cloud, from different geographical regions.
