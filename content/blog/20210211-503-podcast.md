This must be the month for trying new things, because I jumped into livestreaming with the first ever [k6 Office Hours](/blog/20210205-k6-office-hours) just a week ago, and this week I'm jumping into podcasting with [Simme Aronsson](https://simme.dev), who's also doing the Office Hours with me. There's definitely safety (at least psychological safety) in numbers, because doing it with someone else makes me feel a little more brave.

While the podcast is presented by [k6](https://k6.io), that's really just a fancy term for saying that we're both employed by k6 and we're recording and producing the podcast on company time. Unlike the Office Hours, which is heavily k6-focused, the podcast will be about software performance and reliability in general. Simme and I happen to have different and complementary skillsets (he comes from a developer background, and I come from a testing background, and I think that makes for an interesting combination of perspectives.

Here's the first episode! It should also be available on your audio podcasting tool of choice.
