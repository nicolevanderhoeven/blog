My friend [Marie Cruz](https://testingwithmarie.com) and I speak to Lena Pejgan Nyström, the author and creator of [Would Heu-risk it?](https://pejgan.se/WHRI.htm) cards and book about various topics! 

Lena opens up about how she got started in tech and her career journey from being a developer turned tester and now an Engineering Manager as well as an international keynote speaker! We also discuss topics such as diversity in tech, dealing with burnout, and any struggles Lena experienced between making a career and being true to her personal beliefs.
