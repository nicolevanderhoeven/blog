We haven't travelled since January 2020 for obvious reasons, but fortunately (?) I have a whole lot of footage taken from trips pre-pandemic that I haven't yet turned into travel vlogs. In case you weren't aware, I learned a lot of what I know now about creating videos from making travel vlogs for friends and family as my husband and I travelled around the world for months at a time.

Here's a trip we took in September 2018. We had just finished off a trip to Greece with some friends from Australia, and on the way home, I decided to book a three-day stopover in Sofia, Bulgaria-- a city I really knew next to nothing about. Here's that first day!
