The k6 virtual office is open!

The first time I heard about office hours was from [Notion](https://www.notion.so/). Recently, [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) went in on this trend as well. The concept involves opening your virtual doors regularly to your community, to answer questions and share best practices. 

A big part of being a Developer Advocate is talking _to_ people, and even conferences these days are mostly pre-recorded. I kind of miss being able to interact _with_ people. I miss the immediacy of _live_. So I talked [Simme Aronsson](https://simme.dev) into doing a k6 Office Hours with me.

We're both new to livestreaming, so there's a lot that we've learned and will be improving in future videos, but here's our first attempt!
