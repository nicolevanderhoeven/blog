In this video, I talk about how to get started with Obsidian for non-coders, specifically tackling topics like what Markdown is and how to use it to write notes in Obsidian. I also talk about some Obsidian-specific syntax that help you do things like embed Obsidian notes, create footnotes, and create queries to find the right note.
