I've gotten a few questions asking me how I do text expansion in Obsidian, because there are a lot of text expander plugins out there. The truth, though, is that I don't use any of them. Instead, I use a separate, free, open-source app called Espanso to define text triggers and replace them with certain phrases. One of the best things about Espanso is that it stores all configuration in plain text files.
