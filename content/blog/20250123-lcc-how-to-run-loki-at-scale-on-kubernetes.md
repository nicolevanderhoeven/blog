Happy New Year from the Loki Engineering team. To kick off 2025, Nicole and Jay will be joined by Poyzan Taneli from the Loki Engineering team to discuss how to run Loki at scale on Kubernetes. If you are currently running Loki in microservices mode or preparing to do so, we will be discussing best practices for scaling its components to meet the demands of production use cases.

- How many Ingesters vs Queriers do I need?
- What is the minimum cost of running Loki as a production cluster?
- What is the average node size for running Loki?
How do I monitor my Loki deployment?
