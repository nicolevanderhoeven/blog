Here's an overview of Obsidian: what it is, why everyone's using it, and how to get started with Obsidian for beginners with a brand new course called Obsidian for Everyone. I'm extremely proud of the course and I can't wait to share it with you after working on it for what seems like forever. It contains everything you need to know to use Obsidian -- but without installing any third-party community plugins.
