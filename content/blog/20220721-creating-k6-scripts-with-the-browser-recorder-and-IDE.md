In this video, I talk about creating k6 scripts with the browser recorder and by using your favorite IDE. Scripts in k6 can be created through the Test Builder on the k6 Cloud, but sometimes you just want to hit record instead of starting from scratch. Also in this video is a rundown on the basics of using the k6 CLI and some important commands for running tests locally and on the cloud-- right from your command line.
