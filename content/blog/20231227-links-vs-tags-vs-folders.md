If you've ever questioned the benefits of links vs tags vs folders, my guest today, [Jorge Arango](https://jarango.com), has some opinions about which method is best for you when creating a knowledge garden in Obsidian. Information architecture is a field of design that makes it easier to find information, and I'm talking to Jorge today about how the same principles can be used to find things in your notes.

Jorge is an information architect, author, and educator. For the past 25 years, he has used architectural thinking to bring clarity and alignment to digital products and services. Heâ€™s the author of Living in Information: Responsible Design for Digital Places, co-author of Information Architecture: for the Web and Beyond, and host of The Informed Life podcast. Besides consulting, writing, and podcasting, Jorge also teaches in the graduate interaction design program at the California College of the Arts.
