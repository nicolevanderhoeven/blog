This week, we had [Odysseas Lamtzidis](https://twitter.com/odysseas_lam) on the show to talk about [Netdata](https://netdata.cloud), which is an application performance monitoring tool that prides itself on having the easiest setup ever. Odysseas admitted that it might not have all the bells and whistles of other monitoring platforms, it Just Works. I see this as being very interesting especially for testers like me, who just want to have something set up but might not want to be bothered by the implementation.
