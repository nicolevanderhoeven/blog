What do you do with all those notes? In this presentation, I talk about how to create things with your notes. I demonstrate my process of going from raw notes to this very presentation and share some of my strategies for creating output with little effort by learning in public and identifying topics to create content about using existing notes.

On May 19th, I did a talk at the [Linking Your Thinking Conference](https://nicolevanderhoeven.com/blog/20220519-use-it-or-lose-it/) about using your notes (or losing them), and about what we can do to make something useful of all our notes. This was my run through!
