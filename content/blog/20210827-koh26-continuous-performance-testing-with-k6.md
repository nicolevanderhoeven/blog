[Lee Barnes](https://twitter.com/USI_LeeBarnes) and I got connected because we are both speaking at [TestCon Europe 2021](https://testcon.lt/) this year, and I thought it would be nice to have a chat with him before the conference to get a sneak peek at what he's presenting about: continuous performance testing. Lee is the CEO of [Utopia Solutions](https://utopiasolutions.com/), and he's been in the testing industry for decades, so I really appreciated his insights on where the industry is going.
