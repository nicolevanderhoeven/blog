My friend [Paul Balogh](https://javaducky.com) and I interview [Ryan Perry](https://ryanperry.io), co-founder of Grafana Pyroscope, about how to do continuous profiling right. Ryan, and the rest of the Pyroscope team, joined Grafana Labs, where he is now a Director of Engineer. Ryan discusses the main concerns in continuous profiling and how to avoid those pitfalls. Pyroscope is an open-source project for aggregating continuous profiling data about your system's resources.
