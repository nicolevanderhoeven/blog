In this episode of Adobo and Avocados, my friend [Marie Cruz](https://testingwithmarie.com) and I chat with [Maaret Pyhäjärvi](https://maaretp.com/), a Development Manager and Testing Specialist who has shared countless resources about exploratory testing. We talk about her journey to tech, the benefits and dangers of public speaking, and her approach to testing.
