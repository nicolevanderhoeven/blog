For this episode of k6 Office Hours, I got the k6 Chief Technical Officer, Pawel Suwala, to give a bit of a behind-the-scenes of how we work at k6 and what we're working on next. We talked about the methodology we use for building k6, the different teams we have, and exciting new features that are coming soon!
