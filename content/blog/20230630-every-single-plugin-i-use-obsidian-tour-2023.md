In this video, I talk about all the Obsidian plugins I currently use... all 46 of them. I demonstrate some of them, talk about why I didn't keep others, and talk through my use cases for each one. These plugins aren't necessarily the best ones out there for Obsidian - they're just the ones that are useful enough for my use cases to have them installed on a daily basis.
