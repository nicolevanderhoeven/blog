Introducing: Tabs in Obsidian v1.0! Obsidian's latest release brings tab functionality to Obsidian, further adding to its flexibility in terms of letting us build workspaces the way we want. We can now have tabs in Obsidian and use them the way we would browser tabs. This release also came with some improvements for themes and the overall Obsidian UI.
