# Places I've worked
## k6.io (2020-Present)
### Developer Advocate
_(remote)_

I joined [k6.io](https://k6.io) in November 2020 as a Developer Advocate, specializing in Performance Testing. k6 is a [free and open source tool](https://github.com/loadimpact/k6) for load testing, with the goal of making the process as developer-friendly as possible. The company also has a related SaaS platform, [k6 Cloud](https://k6.io/cloud), which is an easy way to scale up load tests on the cloud.

So far, I've created a series of videos on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/c/k6test) covering my [Week of Testing](/blog/week-of-testing-intro/) of the k6 ecosystem. I'm still learning the tool, but I'm excited to draw on my load testing experience to build up a body of knowledge around load testing best practices.

## flood.io (2018-2020)
### Performance Testing Advocate
_(remote)_

[Tricentis](https://www.tricentis.com) [Flood](https://flood.io) is a SaaS load testing platform for running load testing scripts of leading open source tools. I had a very mixed role where I created written, video, and audio content on load testing and how to use Flood, gave presentations at conferences, managed social media accounts and the company blog, responded to customer support queries, and coached clients all over the world on how to use load testing to improve software quality. I really enjoyed working for a small, closely-knit team and being able to jump into different roles at the drop of a hat. I also got to write a book on API load testing.

## Accenture (2017-2018)
### Test Engineering Associate Manager
_Heerlen, the Netherlands_

I worked at [APG](https://apg.nl/), a large pension provider in the Netherlands, as a performance testing consultant. I was able to help several projects identify performance issues before go-live and set up a stubbing tool to virtualise key components that interfered with testing. I also worked on a test strategy for load testing a blockchain. All communication was in Dutch.

## Tabcorp Holdings Ltd. (2016-2017)
### Performance Test Analyst
_Melbourne, Australia_

I was part of the closely-knit performance testing team that carried out load and resilience testing for [Tabcorp](https://tabcorp.com.au), the largest gaming corporation in Australia, including preparation for the world-famous Melbourne Cup racing carnival. This was a massive and exciting undertaking, with multiple traffic channels and applications that needed to be tested.

## Planit Software Testing (2014-2016)
### Senior Technical Test Analyst
_Melbourne and Sydney, Australia_

[Planit](https://planittesting.com) is a multinational professional services consultancy. I worked as a technical testing consultant to set up performance testing frameworks, formulate test strategies, and execute load testing for companies in a variety of industries. Consulting is a frenzied period of rapid-pace learning, and I actually relished the new challenges that came with every new project.

## Access HQ (2012-2014)
### Test Analyst
_Melbourne, Australia_

This was my first official job as a tester for [Access HQ](https://www.accesshq.com/), a testing consultancy company. I was lucky enough to find a mentor and get a headstart in performance testing right away. As a testing consultant, I helped teams write realistic load tests and analyze the results. I also crossed over into functional testing for a time, appreciating the need for more rigid testing practices at some projects.

## Jetstar Airways (2011-2012)
### Engineering Records supervisor, junior test analyst
_Melbourne, Australia_

At [Jetstar](https://www.jetstar.com/), the low-cost branch of the national airline, I analyzed aircraft engine component records to determine maintenance schedules. I led a team of 8 analysts. Towards the end, I discovered software testing when I was asked to test and assess a tool that the company wanted to purchase.

## Intrinsic Technologies (2008-2011)
### Data analyst
_Melbourne, Australia_

While I worked on my permanent visa in Australia, I worked part-time as a data analyst at a small startup. I helped improve Intrinsic Technologies's predictive analysis software for forecasting project outcomes in software testing.

## EnergyOpt, Inc. (2007-2008)
### Data analyst
_Manila, the Philippines_

I joined EnergyOpt right out of university. EnergyOpt was working on software to facilitate the purchase and sale of electricity, in line with the country's impending electricity privatization act. I employed econometric techniques to set prices and improve the software's responsiveness to market demand.
