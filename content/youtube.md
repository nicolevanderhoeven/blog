I am always interested in learning about the intricacies of the finances of a YouTuber, so when I started [a YouTube channel](https://youtube.com/nicolevanderhoeven) in November 2021, I decided I'd document the process of making money from it, in case others are interested too.


## 2022

### March 2022

I got monetized on March 28th, 2022 (four months after I started this channel), and because of the timing and the 100 € payout minimum, I didn't see AdSense money until May.
