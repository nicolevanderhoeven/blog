# Gear I Use
One of my favorite obsessions is watching or reading about the gear other people use. I've watched almost every "What's in my tech bag" video on YouTube, it feels like, and I'm always prowling blog posts that detail what someone is using. In case there's anybody out there that is as interested in these things as I am, here's an overview of the gear that I use to make videos, write both blog posts and code, and generally mess around on the internet.

## Home Office 1 (the Netherlands)

## Home Office 2 (Portugal)

I live between two countries: the Netherlands and Portugal. Since I spend a few months in each place, that also means I need a place to work in each apartment! My home office in Portugal is larger but definitely less well-equipped. It's a little embarrassing, but I thought it would be interesting to show a more realistic, in-progress setup.

Why yes, I do indeed have clothes hanging on a rack behind my desk to try and soak up sound.
